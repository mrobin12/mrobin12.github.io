Comp 20 Assignment 1: Your Portfolio
Michael Robinson

All aspects of the assignment have been implemented correctly. All of the required files have been created and the specified content included. All content was created using only HTML and CSS. I have successfully redirected my http://www.cs.tufts.edu/~mrobin12 website to https://mrobin12.github.io. All HTML and CSS files pass the appropriate w3 validators. I have shared this assignment with a friend of mine who works as a programmer, to get his feedback and critiques. I spent approximately 4hrs completing this assignment.
