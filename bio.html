		<h1>Biography</h1>
		<p> I was born in Albuquerque, NM and had in the southwest for my entire life. That was until two years ago when I relocated to Boston. I grew up in the small town of Silver City, NM where Billy the Kid once spent time back in the 1800's. I attended the University of New Mexico from 2008 to 2012, where I earned a bachelor of science degree in mechanical engineering. During my senior year, I contemplated going immediately to graduate school, but lacked a specific direction of study. Instead of blindly pursuing another degree, I took the following year to travel and explore Europe, backpacking my way from hostel to hostel, working odd jobs when I could find them. My most obscure one was herding sheep parttime in the western Scottish isles. When I returned in the summer of 2013, I chose to live in Crested Butte, Colorado and be a mountain bike/ski bum - I even had the long hair to match. During this time I worked at one of the smaller local hotels as an Assistant Manager. A hairbrained idea saw me move to Boulder and attend the University of Colorado for a year as a pre-med post-bac student, but I realized midway through that medical school was not the direction I wanted to go in. After I completed the school year, I moved to Albuquerque, New Mexico where I found a job as a sales representative for an orthopedic implant company. It was during this time that I met my current girlfriend who was finishing graduate school at UNM. She had plans to return to the northeast, where she was originally from, upon graduation and me being completely lovestruck concocted a plan that allowed me to move to Boston so we could be together. Fastforward nearly two years, we both now live in Boston, where I was able to transfer my job with Zimmer Biomet and she found work as a speech pathologist. Knowing that orthopedic sales was not what I wanted to do as a permanent career, I looked into ways to return to my educational roots as an engineer, and applied to post-bac programs in the area. As of January 2018, I have been admitted to Tufts University as a post-bac student in computer science, an area that I have had an interest in since undergrad but never pursued. The program has been great so far and I am relishing the opportunity to study in this field! My hope is to continue on to graduate school at the end of this program to earn my master's degree as a computer scientist.
