		<h1>Biography</h1>
		<p> 
			I was born in Albuquerque, NM and had lived in the southwest for my entire life. That was until two years ago when I relocated to Boston. I grew up in the small town of Silver City, NM and attended the University of New Mexico from 2008 to 2012, where I earned a bachelor of science degree in mechanical engineering. During my senior year, I contemplated going immediately to graduate school, but lacked a specific direction of study. Instead of immediately pursuing another degree, I took the following year to travel and explore, working odd jobs when I could find them. The most obscure of them was being a hostel and sheep caretaker in the western Scottish isles.</p>
		<p> 
			In 2015, I moved back to Albuquerque, New Mexico where I found a job as a sales representative for the orthopedic implant company, Zimmer Biomet. My initial roll was as a member of the area's trauma team which serviced New Mexico's only Level 1 trauma center at the University of New Mexico Hospital. It was during this time that I met my girlfriend who was finishing graduate school at UNM. She was originally from the northeast and planned to move back after graduation. Thankfully, due to the large nature of my company, I was able to contact the Zimmer Biomet division in New England and apply for a position. </p>
		<p> 
			Fastforward nearly two years, we live just north of Boston, where I successfully transferred my job with Zimmer Biomet and she found work as a speech pathologist. Knowing that orthopedic sales was not what I wanted to do as a permanent career, I looked into ways to return to my educational roots as an engineer, which led me to applying to post-bac programs in the area. As of January 2018, I have been admitted to Tufts University as a post-bac student in computer science, an area that I have had an interest in since undergrad but never pursued. The program is incredible and I am relishing the opportunity to study in this field! My plan is to complete the post-bac program in December 2018 and transition full-time into the Tufts' master's computer science program the following semester. I am particularly interested in cybersecurity, full-stack web development, and networks.
