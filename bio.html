		<h1>Biography</h1>
		<p> I was born in Albuquerque, NM and had in the southwest for my entire life. That was until two years ago when I relocated to Boston. I grew up in the small town of Silver City, NM where Billy the Kid once spent time back in the 1800's. I attended the University of New Mexico from 2008 to 2012, where I earned a bachelor of science degree in mechanical engineering. During my senior year, I contemplated going immediately to graduate school, but lacked a specific direction that I wanted to go in. Instead of blindly pursuing another degree, I took the year to travel and explore. When I returned in the summer of 2013, I chose to live in Crested Butte, Colorado and be a mountain bike/ski bum - I even had the long hair to match.
