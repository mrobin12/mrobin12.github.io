		<h1>Biography</h1>
		<p> I was born in Albuquerque, NM and had in the southwest for my entire life. That was until two years ago when I relocated to Boston. I grew up in the small town of Silver City, NM where Billy the Kid once spent time back in the 1800's. I attended the University of New Mexico from 2008 to 2012, where I earned a bachelor of science degree in mechanical engineering. During my senior year, I contemplated going immediately to graduate school, but lacked a specific direction of study. Instead of blindly pursuing another degree, I took the following year to travel and explore Europe, backpacking my way from hostel to hostel, working odd jobs when I could find them. My most obscure one was herding sheep parttime in the western Scottish isles. When I returned in the summer of 2013, I chose to live in Crested Butte, Colorado and be a mountain bike/ski bum - I even had the long hair to match. During this time I worked at one of the smaller local hotels as an Assistant Manager. A hairbrained idea saw me move to Boulder and attend the University of Colorado for a year as a pre-med post-bac student, but I realized midway through that medical school was not the direction I wanted to go in. After I completed the school year, I moved to Albuquerque, New Mexico where I found a job as a sales representative for the orthopedic implant company Zimmer Biomet. It was during this time that I met my current girlfriend who was finishing graduate school at UNM.
